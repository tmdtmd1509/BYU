
Percentages represent lines of code, not time spent.
This is intended to give you some measure of how big
each part of the project is, but please realize that
lines-of-code does not always correlate directly to
time spent.

For example, even though the MapFragment represents
9.9% of the code, this part is more time consuming 
than that because of the need to learn how to use 
Google's or Amazon's map fragment.

Additionally, the first activity you write that
uses RecyclerView will probably also take in inordinate
amount of time, because of the time needed to learn how
to use RecyclerView.  After you've successfully used
RecyclerView once, the other activites that use it will
tend to go faster.
